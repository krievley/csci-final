            <description>This seminar will examine contemporary novels concerned with the relationship between the environmental and psychic management of material waste, and the formation of outcast communities. We will explore how and why these novels link trash and decay with processes of social exclusion. &amp;nbsp;By studying novels alongside related films, images, and essays, we will consider the place of waste in contemporary culture and ask what fiction, in particular, can contribute to discussions about trash, ecological disasters, and marginalized communities.</description>
